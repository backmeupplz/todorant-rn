Productivity systems fail. Todorant doesn't. A carefully crafted set of limitations and praise teaches the primitive part of the brain to crave productivity like we crave sugar. While other apps focus on storing, organizing and automating endless lists of to-dos, Todorant focuses on what matters: completing tasks.

— No more "projects": this concept never works in the long term (we all have "sport", "self-improvement", "someday maybe" lists that we never open)
— No more dangling to-dos: every task has a date or a month assigned to it
— Focus on what matters: you only see and work on one task at a time after you finish planning
— Benefit from willpower depletion: mark unpleasant tasks as "frogs" and Todorant will make you do them in the morning when you are most likely to complete them
— Be aware: you always know what to do now and when every task will be completed
— Remember *everything*: no more thinking "Did I forget that thing that my spouse told me to do?", "Should I do taxes now or wait until later?", "What's that thing I had to do for work?"
— Learn to be productive: Todorant gives you the list of rules and constantly reminds you about them

Why does it work?

I've read and tried over 20 books and productivity methodologies. I'm sure you tried a few yourselves. Unfortunately, they never helped me: they were either lacking features or were too overcomplicated. So I combined them all and simplified the result. I took away everything that doesn't help or hurts productivity and left what helps.

The reason Todorant works is that it does not overwhelm your "smart" brain, appeals to your "primitive" brain and never gives you anxiety about undone tasks. Try it today, don't delay the positive change in your life!
