I'll get straight to the point: to do lists are lame. But this app fixes them. How?

By doing less. Todorant offers methodology, not another useless list where you put all the tasks and forget about them. Todorant tricks your brain into doing stuff.

Tired of task managers never working for you? Try Todorant. It helped me to finally complete 7 projects in 2019. It can help you too. No strings attached, try for free for the first 30 days. You live will change â€” mine did.
